# README

This contains versions of the Inspection Rover case study model that we used for the "Varanus: Runtime Verification for CSP" paper at TAROS 2025 and its extended version with the Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

To re-run the offline checks on our model you can run `python2 varanus-python/varanus.py offline inspection-rover-test/config_rover5_full_log_correct.yaml` for the correct trace, and `python2 varanus-python/varanus.py offline inspection-rover-test/config_rover5_full_log_faulty.yaml` for a faulty trace.
